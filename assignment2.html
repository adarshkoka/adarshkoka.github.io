                <h6 id="description">While looking at other people's websites I noticed that a lot of people consume the
				same types of media as others. Even though there are several types of media to consume in the world, people seem to 
				be drawn to similar things. When it comes to social media, most people seem to use Reddit and Facebook the most: http://people.tamu.edu/~runner123g/ 
				</h6>
				<h6>
				Another reason we consume similar media is most likely because we are all close to the same age. For reasons to take this class, most people put
				that they took the class to learn about how different types of media impact society: http://people.tamu.edu/~sarahajuarez11/
				</h6>
				<h6>
				Although it was kind of rare, I did find some people who's favorite specific type of media was the same as mine. For example at http://people.tamu.edu/~eec150130/
				her favorite video game is Skyrim which is my favorite video game too. 
				
				</h6>
				
				<h6>
				
				I think one thing to take away from this assignment is that people consume similar types of media mainly because they are very popular at that time.
				What I mean is that if a TV show was very popular when it was running, there is a good chance that other people would have watched that show too.
